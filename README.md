### General

Here is a collection of tools to recognize, extract and plot the FACT muon events, extracted from the [photon-stream](https://github.com/fact-project/photon_stream). 

There is a list of FACT event IDs for 13.78 million events which are muon-like. The training sample for a muon-like event recognition is done by hand by Sebastian Müller and Max Nöthe.

Example muon-event in photon-stream representations:
